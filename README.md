This repository contains the data for my  homework assignment question 4

To run this analysis use the following command:

```
Rscript penguins_assignment.Rmd
```

The output graph is made from the Penguins data set found in the palmer penguins package, which will be saved to your computer as a csv file once running the code. The results themselves are in `out`.
